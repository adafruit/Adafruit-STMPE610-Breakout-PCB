This breakout board features the STMPE610, which has both I2C and SPI interfaces available. There is also an interrupt pin that you can use to indicate when a touch has been detected to your microcontroller or microcomputer. We wrapped up the chip with a 3V voltage regulator and level shifting so it's safe to use with 3V or 5V logic. Its a nicely designed chip, and has very stable precise readings. We found its also a lot faster than trying to do all the readings on an Arduino.
